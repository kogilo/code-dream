#### Project: What's for dinner?

- Now that you've learned how to draw and color shapes, use your skills to make something fun: dinner!
- The program below only includes a simple plate, it's up to you to put dinner on the plate. Use shapes like rect(), ellipse(), and triangle() to draw food on the plate. Use fill() and stroke() to color them. Don't remember how to use something? Check the "Documentation" tab and click for examples.
- After you're done, show it to your friends and family. You can even offer to cook it for them tomorrow. :-)
- Don't want to make dinner? Draw some other meal instead.



```
background(186, 145, 20); // wooden table
ellipse(200, 200, 350, 350); // plate
ellipse(200, 200, 300, 300);
fill(71, 37, 13);
ellipse(200, 200, 250, 250); // Ethiopian brown Ingera

fill(191, 114, 27);
triangle(200,300, 220, 230, 260, 300); // 1st bread 

triangle(270,100, 200, 100, 260, 170); // 2nd bread

fill(12, 105, 54);
rect(100, 130, 50, 60, 10); // 1st green vagi
rect(100, 210, 50, 60, 10); // 2nd green vagi

fill(97, 16, 16);
ellipse(200, 200, 60, 60); // row meat

fill(0, 255, 13);
rect(260, 210, 60, 10, 5); // 1st green pepper
rect(260, 230, 60, 10, 5); // 2nd green pepper
```
