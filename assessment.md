### Assessment 
- 3. What are your career goals? In what type of work environment can you see yourself working? Why?

```
I set my career goal three years ago as “Becoming a Data Scientist by 2025”.  Since then I have taken many data science or analytics courses both online and in-person.
However, I found out that it is so hard to get a job with those courses without understanding other programming languages for web development such as JavaScript, React, Node, and the likes. 
I like programming because I would like to see myself working independently, anywhere and create values for either organization or society at large. 


```

- 4. What is GitHub?
```
GitHub is an open-source repository hosting service that allows you to store or host your codes or other non code documents.  
It is a version control tool that allows developers to collaborate on the same project even though they are far apart. 
Because it is open source, in addition to your team, any person can view, review and propose a change to your project. 
It is called version control because each and every one can create their version, work on it independently and finally push it to the main branch or version and finally the administrator merges it into the main version.

- 5. Write an example of declaring a variable and assigning it a value.

- 6. Write an example of a function that adds two numbers and returns the result.

```

	retun num1 + num2;

- 7. Create an array with the names of four fruits in it. Set the array equal to the variable “fruits”.

```
var fruits = ["orange", 'banana', 'mango', 'lemon']
```


- 8. Create an object that stores the following data about you: your age, three of your favorite movies or books, your hometown, and today’s date.
